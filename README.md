👋 Hi, I’m Ernest Low

I'm a Software Engineer from Singapore

About me:
As a driven and self-motivated Software Engineer, my journey began with a deep passion for technology and computer engineering. Over the years, I've dedicated myself to continuous self-study, going through full stack development training in General Assembly and seeking opportunities to improve my programming skillsets. 

Working in dynamic environments has provided consistent opportunities for technical skill development, enabling me to deepen my expertise with each project undertaken. I am committed to advancing my professional growth and making meaningful contributions to my career and impactful projects in the software engineering field.

🌱 I’m currently learning more on node.js backend and AWS DevOps
🏋🏼‍♂️ I'm in the process of revisiting my past skills and modernizing them, essentially updating an older project.
💬 Ask me about frontend Typescript / React

Expect updates soon
